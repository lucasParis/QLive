QLive
=====

QLive is a cues-based software to help the creation of mixed music 
(live instruments + electronic).
  
todo list:
----------
- big cleanup: documentation, and routing modular
- soundfile section: excel style
- documentation/archivage prototype
- preferences systeme
- creatorId must be based on the effects name. Otherwise, if the 
order changed (like when I create the FxNone), previous saved file
won't work anymore...
- An FxBox with different background colour for bypassed effects?

fonctionalite:
- soundcard setup menu (on launch?)
- midi cue triggering 
- record master out
